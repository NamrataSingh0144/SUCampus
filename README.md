✨ About The Project
Campus Connect is a mobile-first platform aimed at creating a fully integrated digital ecosystem for college campuses. The primary goal is to bridge the gap between students/faculty and on-campus vendors (restaurants, shops, etc.) by providing a unified app for ordering, booking services, and handling payments.

The application is designed with three distinct user portals to cater to the unique needs of each group: a user-friendly interface for Students, a powerful dashboard for Shop Owners, and a comprehensive management panel for Admins.
